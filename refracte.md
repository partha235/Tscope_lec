# <span style="color:rgb(200,50,30)"><u>Refractive Telescope</u></span>
Refraction refers to change in direction of waves from on medium to another which makes change in it's speed. Refractive index varies according to wavelength. The refractor also known as **dioptrics**, that uses lenses to refract (bend) the light collected on telescope. The first telescope invented is also a refractor type. This refraction causes the parallel light rays converge at a focal point at the opposite end, where they can be  magnified by the eyepiece. The objective lense are comprises of two or more individual lense bonded and arranged together called *objective lens cell*. To observe the image formed by the objective lens, an eyepiece is positioned near the focal point. The eyepiece magnifies and straightens the light to observe. The point where all light paths interact is called focal point. It has high contrast than reflective type due to absence of secondary mirror which act as obstruction. It cools quickly.

Based on design of objective lense refractive telescope divided in to **achromatic** and **apochromatic**.
### <span style="color:rgb(30,25,250);background :green"> Chromatic Aberration</span>
 One of the problems that refracting telescopes suffer from is chromatic aberration.<br>

This is because of that light of different wavelength passing at same time and thus refractive index varies with wavelength. This can be minimized by using two different types of glass together known as achromatic. This also can be decreased with increase in the focal length. The inclusion of extra-low dispersion (ED) glass elements can also deliver very good results.There is also a more complex design called an apochromat that is specifically designed to bring all the wavelengths of visible light to the same point of focus, resulting in high-quality images.It uses three glass elements, one of which is commonly made from ED glass known as apochromatic.
