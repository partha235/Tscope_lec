# Dobsonian Telescope
It is a low cost design of Newtonian scope and best for night sky and eye watching. It was first made in the 1960s by American telescope maker, John Dobson.He nicknamed this project â€œthe sidewalk telescope". Dobsonians are low-budget, user-friendly and offered the possibility of owning a large aperture telescope at home. The Dobsonian design offers the Newtonian reflector on a simplistic Alt-Az mount whereby the user can push/pull the telescope in a horizontal/vertical motion to locate targets.

The base is crafted with wood or sturdy materials. It's low centered gravity ensure balancing of the scope.
### <u>Alt-Azimuth mount</u>
It is the most easy mount for telescope. Alt-Azimuth is for altitude and azimuth. Altitude is up or down and azimuth is left or right.

###<u>Errors & Corrections </u>
As it has secondary reflecting mirror which is aligned $45\degree$ to the eyepiece where image is observed. The minor change in the angle of secondary reflector mirror cause the image misaligned. It could be corrected by adjusting the mounting screw of secondary mirror. Sometimes the view finder will be misaligned to the main scope. It will be corrected by calibration.
