## Glass
Glass is an amorphous solid (a solid without the regular crystalline structure that something like a metal would have). It is an inorganic solid material (silicon dioxide), an liquid sand.


## Mirror & Lens 
Mirror is the piece of glass which is polished on a side and coated on another for reflection. Lens is a combination of two prism and it was transparent, allowing light to diverge or converge by curved surface by refract (bend).

The image formed by mirror and lens are calculated by 
* Mirror<br>
 $\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}$
 * Lens<br>
$\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}$
    - v=> distance of image from pole
    - u=> distance of object from pole 
    - f=> focal length

## Aperture
It is the diameter of the lens or mirror. Gathering of light can be determined with aperture. The higher the aperture the higher the light gathered.

## Focal length
The focal length is described as distance from mirror/lens at where the reflected or refracted light forms a point image (converged). It determine the magnifying power. It is expressed in **millimeter**. The longer the focal length the higher the magnifier. The focal length of an eyepiece (multiple lens) is calculated by<br>
$efl=\frac{f_1 \times f_2}{f_1 +f_2 -d}$
* efl => equivalent focal length
* $f_1$ => focal length of field lens 
* $f_2$ => focal length of eye lens 
* d => separation of lens
