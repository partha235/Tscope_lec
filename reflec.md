# <span style="color:rgb(200,50,30)"><u>Reflective Telescope</u></span>
It uses mirror to reflect back the rays. The reflector telescope was first designed by **Nicolo zucchi** which was so simple and not given enough result. He fall back to making refractive scopes. Lately Jesuit (1616) an Italian scientist tried to rebuild it but not so successful. Two Catholic priest **Marin Mersenne** and **Bonaventura Cavaliri** were the first to successfully deliver the functional reflector telescope named **Mersenne Telescope**.

The designed with an combination of primary concave mirror and secondary mirror. Meanwhile Leonardo da Vinci used concave mirror to study celestial bodies a century before Newton. When the game changer Sir Issac Newton,(1668) enter's to play with the broad mind tried various metals and polish it to improve reflecting capabilities gained him a of scientific community, Royal Society of London. It has incredible light gathering capability. The light gathered in the primary mirror (parabolic mirror) is reflected back to secondary mirror or diagonal mirror.The primary mirror is made of special mirror with aluminum reflective coating. The secondary mirror is flat and positioned $45\degree$ relative to the primary. The light reflected to the secondary is again diverted to focuser where eyepiece present. The counterweight balance is attached to make it easier to handle. In Reflector the aperture is important that the more light it gather the brighter image it be. 
## <span style="color:rgb(80,200,88)"><u>Types</u></span>
Based on construction reflector classified in to three types
1. Newtonian Telescope
2. Cassegrain Telescope
3. Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope

### <span style="color:rgb(200,150,108)">COMA</span>
It is a type of spherical aberration that is a result of when light from objects off the optical axis is not focused properly due to the shape of the mirror. This defect causes off-axis points of light to appear as distorted, comet-shaped images rather than sharp points. For observation COMA will have not occur more than it comes to photography. A coma corrector device is used to overcome in this type than lens.

Generally this types of scope takes much heat and slower in cooling time where cooling fans are used.

### Newtonian Type
Most of the telescope design we used today are based on this Newtonian type. It was so simple and easy.<br>
![Newtonian Type](https://littleastronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/newtonian-diagram.jpg)<br>
This type reflect the light about two-third of the length of the tube (shorter focal length) makes relatively fast observation.
### Cassegrain Type
Also known as catadioptric or compound telescope. This are modern type and extremely popular because of high quality optics.The design was proposed in 1672 by French priest Laurent Cassegrain. <br>

It use combination of mirror and lenses. It has a correcting plate of lens at the entrance which allow light pass through.

### Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope
![SCT](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscopethegalaxy.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F12%2F20201224_224047_0000.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=09721778b20ff028597d647bf38f8c8234b8ccf8aef8ab61719f0d388edcf8e7&ipo=images)<br>
The SCT telescope has a primary and secondary mirror, but it also uses a very thin lens called a corrector plate to improve the image. The light path of a Schmidt-Cassegrain is folded, which means the light takes a couple of bounces before it reaches your eye. This is why the SCT telescope tube is shorter than other designs of the same aperture, making it easier to carry, store, and attach to your mount of choice.
