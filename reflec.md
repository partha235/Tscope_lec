It uses mirror to reflect back the rays. The reflector telescope was first designed by Sir Issac Newton, with an idea of mirror can be used to create magnified image in the same way of lense. It has incredible light gathering capability. The light gathered in the primary mirror (parabolic mirror) is reflected back to secondary mirror or diagonal mirror.The primary mirror is made of special mirror with aluminum reflective coating. The secondary mirror is flat and positioned $45\degree$ relative to the primary. The light reflected to the secondary is again diverted to focuser where eyepiece present. The counterweight balance is attached to make it easier to handle.
